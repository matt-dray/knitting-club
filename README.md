Beginner's guide: What is R Markdown and why do you need it?

Live version here: https://matt-dray.github.io/knitting-club/

>Do you have *woolly* knowledge of document creation in R? *Needle* little help? Matt Dray will *drop* some *purls* of wisdom and unravel a *yarn* about the *knitty*-gritty of R Markdown and the ‘knitr’ package for one-click document creation. Don’t get the *point*? If a deadline is *looming*, you’ll avoid a *stitch*-up from endless re-running of code and copy-pasting of outputs into a Word document. Come along and have a *ball*!

Delivered 7 April 2018 at a departmental Coffee & Coding session.
